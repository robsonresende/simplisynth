## Files:

### index.html
The **index.html** file serves as the foundational structure for the entire website, containing all the necessary HTML code. This file is organized into a central **container** division, which is subdivided into three distinct sections: **head**, **main**, and **footer**. Each of these sections plays a crucial role in the overall functionality and presentation of the site.

- The **head** section includes three user interface controls specifically designed to adjust the sound settings. These controls are as follows:
   - A **radio-type input field** that enables the user to alter the frequency of each musical note by shifting it up or down by an octave.
   - A **select dropdown** that allows the user to choose the desired waveform, thus influencing the tonal quality of the sound.
   - A **checkbox** that toggles the activation of **tremolo**, enabling or disabling this effect for the generated sound.

- The **main** section of the page features the interactive **keyboard**, along with **frequency data** for each musical note, providing users with both visual and auditory information.

- The **footer** section includes a hyperlink that directs users to the **author's website**, offering additional context related to the project.

To ensure optimal layout and responsiveness, both the **container** and its internal components are structured using **CSS Grid**. The use of CSS Grid was specifically chosen for its ability to create a flexible, responsive design, ensuring that the keyboard and other controls are seamlessly aligned and adapt to various screen sizes, providing a smooth and consistent user experience.
